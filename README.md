# Whitelist

Cyphernomicron mentioned reputation in 2.12.2., but reputation is not feasible without strong liability system. This is caused by transparency anonymity paradox. While user can stay anonymous and reputation can be built, it is not possible to avoid a risk of analysis of the reputation system without revealing true identity of the user.

I propose a system Whitelist, where reputation is interconnected between pseudo-identities and it is based on shared liability. Person use fraction of its property to ensure others, that he will not commit specific act. It is possible, by networking effect, to create **liability system based on shared interconnected liability** based on real connections and trust.

Everybody in a sub-culture can trust each other only if there is binding rule between members.
Liability should exist in long term, because of long time of potential civil, private resolutions or criminal disputes.
Unlike insurance, which is based in unpredictable events, direct shared liability is better option which has significant impact on specific decision making and brings responsibility to everyday life.
Everybody can have right to create his own anonymous virtual jurisdiction, which can be based on liability. 

Network effect is stronger by every connection represented by contract in the network between members without additional extra cost. Liability can be spread between members while new participants has to build the reputation from the ground. This concept has two layers:

1. original pledge - which doesnâ€™t have much effect without network effect. Fraud can be easily detected.
2. additional guarantee - provided by other members of community. Even person without original pledge can have great reputation based on liability of other participants of the network. In the network can be attacker easily filtered out by prediction model and analysis of the network connections because of:
    1. insufficient guarantee;
    2. no network connection with other members of the same community;
    3. early stage of the profile.
